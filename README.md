# Breast-cancer(python)
This project is building a machine learning model through SVM classifier and handling the breast cancer dataset to bring the best possible accuracy of the outcome.et

Steps that are involved in building the machine learning model and finding the accuracy:

1) Importing the libraries that are required.
2) Importing the "breast cancer" dataset .
3) Describing the data of dataset.
4) Plotting various graphs like "Scatter plot,Bar plot,count plot,violin plot,distplot,Kde plot,Strip plot,etc " to analyse the data.
5) Training and testing the dataset.
6) Building SVM classifier model.
7) Predicting the model using X-test.
8) Finding the confusion matrix with y-test,y-pred.
9) Finding the accuracy of prediction class.
10) Analysing the predicted class with count plot.
